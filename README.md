This is a simple project where I've put into practice various web development concepts, including:

  - Script Tag: I've included JavaScript code in my HTML using script tags to make the webpage interactive.
  
  - Variables: I've used variables to store and manage data within my JavaScript code.
  
  - Numbers: I've worked with numerical data types for calculations and displaying numeric values.
  
  - Strings: I've manipulated strings to customize text content on the webpage.
  
  - console.log(): I've used console.log() to log messages and data to the browser's console for debugging and tracking the program's execution.
  
  - Functions: I've defined and used functions to encapsulate reusable blocks of code.
  
  - The DOM (Document Object Model): I've interacted with the DOM to dynamically update and manipulate the webpage's content.
  
  - getElementById(): I've utilized the getElementById() method to select specific elements on the webpage by their unique IDs.
  
  - innerText and innerContent: I've modified elements' innerText and textContent properties to update the displayed content.

Quick start:
