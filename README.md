This is a simple project where I've put into practice various web development concepts, including:

  -Script Tags: Added JavaScript code to my HTML using script tags to make the webpage interactive.

  - Variables: Used variables to store and manage data in my JavaScript code.

  - Numbers: Worked with numbers for calculations and displaying numeric values.

  - Strings: Manipulated strings to customize text content on the webpage.

  - console.log(): To log messages and data to the browser's console for debugging and tracking the program's execution.

  - Functions: Created functions to group and reuse blocks of code.

  - The DOM: Interacted with the DOM to dynamically update and manipulate the webpage's content.

  - getElementById(): Used to select specific elements on the webpage by their unique IDs.

  - innerText and textContent: Changed elements' innerText and textContent properties to update the displayed content.
